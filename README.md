CHERRY BLOBS:  
Pinkish blobs made of a gelatinous mixture of cherry juice.

Spooky ghosts who haunt the forest, attacking any intruders.  
Come in blue and purple variations, the purple ones being more powerful.  
They will sneak up on you and drain your health if you're not careful!  
They deal no knockback and take no knockback since they're incorporeal.
